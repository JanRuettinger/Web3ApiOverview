	Onboarding: "The first steps of the onboarding are smoothes. The API has one public key which everybody can use for free. The API follows the OpenAPI standard that's why you can automatically generate an interactive SwaggerUI documentation. \
	Here is the link: https://api.zapper.fi/api/static/index.html#. Following the OpenAPI standard also allows you to generate libs for every language automatically. Another advantage of following the OpenAPI standard is that you can easily. A User who tried that ran into some inconsistencies which he describes here: https://discord.com/channels/647279669388771329/650654989202489354/950746375602196480. The SwaggerAPI makes it easy to interactively explore different API end points, however, after the inital try out phase a written documentation would be a big time saver.",

	SupportedEndPoints: "Zapper API has a very comprehensive set of DeFi end points. You can get all kinds of information about a user's token balance in his wallet as well as in other protoccols. On top, the API can trigger bridge, swap and transfer transactions for a user.",
	LongTermPerspective: "The API is not the core product of Zapper. Therefore, it will always be a byproduct which only receives support on the side. Also, be aware that you share your product analytics data with Zapper. They know exactly what your users are doing.",
	PersonalOpinion: "I like the API and can recommend it for DeFi related applications."
